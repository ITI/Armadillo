      <h2>CyPSA Use Cases - Asset Inventory</h2>
      <p>This document outlines a <em>workflow</em> that may
	      be <em>expressed</em> via a particular user interface
	      (e.g. web interface).  The workflow itself, however,
	      should ideally be robust to new interfaces and interface
	      designs.  We look at a <em>workflow</em> as a sequence
	      of steps taken by a practitioner.  Our goal is to
	      streamline these practitioner workflows via the CyPSA
	      tool.  For our purposes, many of these use cases will be
	      realized in terms of the CyPSA 8 Substation Model.</p>

      <h2>CyPSA Use Cases - Asset Inventory Workflow</h2>
      <p>For now, assume that the user is an IT System Administrator
	who wants to understand more about her substation network.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>User authenticates to the system as an IT System
	Administrator.  This may be implemented by a variety of
	authentication schemes (user login).</li>
	<li>The substation network is traditionally documented in a
	static Visio file.  In contrast, CyPSA can load that same
	information from a static JSON file from the 8 substation
	  model.  Two things need to be implemented here:  (a) how to
	load the model, and (b) how to view the model
	(e.g. toggle between graph-based or tabular views).</li>
	<li>The vertices and edges within the model, once loaded, are
	tagged with provenance metadata (e.g. where did this data come
	  from?).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Now imagine that the same user wants to better understand the
      importance of each cyber asset relative to its relations to
	assets in the substation yard.</p>
      <ol>
	<li>User needs to authenticate to the system as a Power
	  Engineer (as well as an IT System Administrator).  This
	  workflow step may be implemented by a variety of
	  authentication schemes (e.g. user login).</li>
	<li>Load a version of the power node-breaker model and merge
	it with that of the JSON file (via static node
	  interconnections).  This may be implemented by viewing the
	data graphically or in a tabular format.</li>
	<li>The vertices and edges within the model, once loaded, are
	  annotated with provenance metadata.</li>
      </ol>	

      <p>So far, we have seen assets loaded from a static model.  This
      is visually displayed in the following diagram in which the
      <a href="../framework/model.html">CyPSA Object Model</a> is
      annotated with data sources for those types of information.
      Blue boxes correspond to CPTL models for each of the
      system components pulled from a filesystem.  In contrast, green
      boxes correspond to services that dynamically provide data such
      as PowerWorld and NPView.</p>
      <img src="../images/use-cases-inventory-assets-workflow-1.png"/>

      <ol>
	<li>Register a PowerWorld data source instance.  This may be
	implemented as a data source wizard that includes the socket
	and authentication information necessary to connect to a
	  PowerWorld service endpoint.</li>
	<li>Register an NPView data source instance.  This may be
	implemented as a data source wizard that includes the socket
	and authentication information necessary to connect to an
	  NPView service endpoint.</li>
	<li>The new data sources will populate the inventory of
	  assets.</li>
	<li>Select a version of the substation yard provided by the
	  new PowerWorld service endpoint and load the information.</li>
	<li>Select assets with just a PowerWorld or FileSystem tag to
	see differences between the two models.  Selection should
	persist across different expressions of the model
	(e.g. graphical or tabular).</li>
	<li>Select a version of the substation network provided by
	  the new NPView service endpoint and load the information.</li>
	<li>Select assets with just an NPView tag to see differences
	between the two models.  Selection should again persist across
	different expressions of the model (graphical or
	tabular).</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Data Source Management</h2>
      <h2>Roles and User Profiles</h2>
      <p>We can have the equivalent of cascading stylesheets for the
	CyPSA data so that users and/or roles and visualize the
	information as needed.</p>
      
      <h2>Annotation Services</h2>
      <p>There are a wide variety of annotation services provided by
	CyPSA and these include the following.  At an abstract level,
	these annotations correspond to vertex and edge attributes.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Annotate model with Vulnerability Information.  NB that
	paths themselves, at an appropriate level of abstraction, may
	be useful to search for as 'attack patterns' in
	infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Annotate model with configuration information.</li>
	<li>...</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h2>Workflow Generation (History)</h2>
      <p>By logging at the appropriate level of abstraction, the
      CyPSA tool can be used to script workflows performed by
      practitioners.</p>
