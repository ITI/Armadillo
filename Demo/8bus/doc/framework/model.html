      <h2>CyPSA Framework Object Model</h2>
      <p>The CyPSA tool inventories and analyzes several different
      kinds of information for the utility that range from individual
      devices to entire substations, to the utility as a whole.  The
      diagram below illustrates the <emph>containment</emph>
      relationship among these objects.  In this section, we will
      briefly describe the objects and data sources from which those
	objects may be retrieved for inventorying or further
	analysis.  The figure below shows the <emph>primary</emph>
      object model for CyPSA (others may be added later).</p>
      
      <img src="../images/framework-object-model.png"/>

      <p>We will now describe objects in terms of those found in the
      (1) Control Center, (2) Substation Network, and (3) Substation
      Yard.  The concept underlying each of these objects is defined
      by CPTL-managed ontologies.</p>
	
      <h3>Control Center Objects</h3>
      <p>We now specify the types of objects found in the control
      center.  Concepts for these object types are found in the
      Enterprise Network Ontology
      ( <a href="../cptl/cptl-spec.html">HTML</a>
      | <a href="https://github.com/ITI/cptl-power/blob/master/src/ontologies/201505-enet.rdf">RDF</a>).
      Many of these descriptions come from Wikipedia.</p>

      <h2>CyPSA Data Sources</h2>
      <p>Utilities have access to a wide variety of data sources
      concerning their assets but lack the ability to easily integrate
      data available from individual devices, state estimation
      applications such as PowerWorld, or network analysis tools such
      as NPView.  As such, CyPSA supports integration of data from the
      following sources so that analytics can readily access that
      information through the object model described above via the
	Data Access Object pattern.</p>

      <p>The CyPSA Data Management Layer indexes the location of
      different kinds of information so that upon request, a service
      (e.g. an analytic) can retrieve and subsequently incorporate
      that information into its algorithm.</p>
