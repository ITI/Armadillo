      <h2>CyPSA Use Case:  Inventory Management</h2>
      <p>Utilities have many different sources of information that
      they may use to manage the inventory of cyber-physical assets
      that include configuration files, EMS systems, images, logs,
      and even schematics.  The CyPSA toolset gives utilities a
      consistent interface by which they can interact with and
      thereby integrate these disparate data sources.  Currently,
      CyPSA integrates cyber-network topological information (via
      NPView), substation node-breaker models (via PowerWorld), and
      the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) database to help
      utilities browse and update their inventory in a changing
	adversarial environment.</p>

      <em>Consider, for example, a utility that is interested in using
	CyPSA to inventory and manage assets.</em>

      <p>Once a utility has an inventory of assets, different
	practitioners may browse them depending upon their roles.</p>
