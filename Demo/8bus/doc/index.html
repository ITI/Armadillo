      <h2>CyPSA Use Cases</h2>
      <p>There are a wide variety of use cases for CyPSA that include
	but are not limited to the following:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>How to understand the impact of cyber vulnerabilities on
	  grid operations?</li>
	<li>How to prioritize cyber security efforts in control
	  networks and substations?</li>
	<li>How to inventory substation assets for NERC CIP compliance
	  audit?</li>
	<li>How to inventory substation assets for education?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most if not all of these applications, however, may be
      distilled into two fundamental activities (1) managing the
      inventory of cyber-physical assets and (2) performing analyses
      upon these assets.  As such, CyPSA is designed to support these
      two activities, whcih although they sound simple, are
      challenging given the disparate sources of information.</p>

      <p>To learn more about how a utility would perform these
	activities, please visit the links in our tutorial:</p>

	    Assets</a></li>

	Cyber-Physical Assets</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The CyPSA Framework - Introduction</h2>
      <p>The CyPSA inventory management and analytics platform may be
      described in terms of the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
      programming pattern.  The CyPSA object model provides the
      interface through which disparate data sources about a utility's
      power system may be queried and integrated.  Data sources may
      range from other applications such as NPView and PowerWorld to
	devices in a substation network.</p>

      <p>The CyPSA application provides a set of views to both
      inventory devices found throughout a utility as well as analyze
      the security of those devices and the system as a whole via
      different security measures.</p>
