      <h2>CyPSA Use Cases (Notebook)</h2>
      <p>The following is a discussion based upon
      an <a href="http://blog.market8.net/b2b-web-design-and-inbound-marketing-blog/how-to-make-useful-website-wireframes-tutorial">article</a>
      on how to write effective use cases.  This document is a work in
      progress.</p>
      
      <h3>Who is the customer?</h3>
      <p>In this case, the customer is a utility.  A variety of
      practitioners within the utility will use the CyPSA tool and
	these include but are not limited to the following:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>IT System Administrator</li>
	<li>Power Engineer</li>
	<li>Visiting Auditor</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Problem are we trying to solve?</h2>
      <p>CyPSA seeks to organize and gain insight into the diverse
      sets of data that a critical infrastructure provider must
      manage.  Specifically CyPSA inventories, manages, and analyzes
      assets and relations among those assets.  A variety of
      interfaces are provided.</p>

      <h3>Assets</h3>

      <p><em>Inventory Assets and Relations:</em> CyPSA inventories
      <b>assets</b> (both cyber and physical).  This may include the
      cataloguing of assets through a common interface.  Data sources
      used to generate a catalogue of assets include PowerWorld,
      NPView, NMap Scans, and device configurations.  Depending upon
      the <b>role</b> of the person using the tool the types of assets
      accessed as well as the data sources through which asset
	information is accessed may vary.</p>

      <p>CyPSA allows practitioners to catalogue <b>relations</b>
      among assets and these may either be manually or programatically
	generated.  </p>
For example, some
	common relations among assets include the following:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Topological Network Data: Which devices and assets are
	connected and how?  Data sources for this kind of information
	include NMap scans, NPView topologies (via Firewall rule
	analysis).</li>
	<li>Security Metrics Outputs:  The output of various security
	metrics such as overall exposure.  This may include the
	Badger as well as the CyPSA engine.</li>
      </ul>
      
      (<a href="use_cases/inventory_assets.html">Inventory Use
      Cases</a>)</p>


      <p><em>Configure Assets:</em>  CyPSA may eventually include the
      ability to configure assets including relays and switches.  For
      example, a system administrator would be able to configure and
	alter the state of a relay via the CyPSA interface.</p>

      <p><em>Annotate Assets:</em> CyPSA also allows practitioners to
      manually and programatically annotate assets.  Sources of
      information with which to annotate assets include provenance
      metadata regarding the data source from which the asset was
      loaded, vulnerability information from vulnerability databases,
	configuration information, and the output oa an analysis in
      general.</p>
